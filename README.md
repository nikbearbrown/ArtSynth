# ArtSynth: Student-Generated Synthetic Art & Design Dataset

## Overview
ArtSynth is a groundbreaking collection of synthetic datasets created by students under Professor Nik Bear Brown at Northeastern University. The project focuses on generating inclusive training data for AI models in art and design, specifically addressing representation gaps and biases in existing datasets.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Create diverse, representative synthetic data for art and design AI training
- Address identified biases in existing creative AI training sets
- Provide students hands-on experience with AI ethics and dataset curation
- Establish a framework for continuous dataset expansion and improvement

## 📊 Dataset Contents
Students select domains within art and design where they identify representation gaps. Current domains include:
- Visual Arts (paintings, illustrations, digital art)
- Graphic Design (logos, layouts, typography)
- Product Design (3D models, prototypes)
- Fashion Design (patterns, garment designs)
- Interior Design (room layouts, color schemes)
- Motion Graphics
- Sound Design
- User Interface Design
